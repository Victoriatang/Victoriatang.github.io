Hi! Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Singapore Management University (SMU), hosted by Prof. [Haiyang Xue](https://haiyangxc.github.io/hyxue/). Before joining SMU, I worked as a cryptography researcher at Ant Group (2022-2024) and completed my PhD at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2016-2022), advised by Prof. [Zhenfeng Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zfzhang?language=en).

I am interested in threshold cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation, and fully homomorphic encryption.
